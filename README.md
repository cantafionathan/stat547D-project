# Transit Ridership and the Seattle Fare Share Ordinance

This project studies whether Seattle’s 2021 **Fare Share ordinance** affected public transit usage, disentangling the policy’s impact from COVID-19 pandemic effects.

Using monthly **unlinked passenger trips (UPT)** data, I construct a **Bayesian structural time series (BSTS)** counterfactual for Seattle based on comparable cities (Portland and Vancouver). Google Community Mobility data and economic controls are used to account for pandemic-driven behavioral changes.

## Data

-   Public transit ridership (Seattle, Portland, Vancouver)
-   Google Community Mobility Reports
-   Weather, gas prices, unemployment
-   Mode share and commuting characteristics

## Methodology

-   Counterfactual inference via BSTS
-   Pre/post policy comparison centered on January 2021
-   Controls for pandemic shocks and seasonal trends

## Goal

Estimate the probability that the Fare Share ordinance caused a statistically meaningful increase in transit ridership beyond the post-pandemic rebound.

## Status

Work in progress.
